# Young_American_Salary

This project is one of my first with R and it was realized during my Economics Licence degree with Neil Dupin & [@LeaBrasseur](https://github.com/LeaBrasseur).

The `Males.xlsx` dataset contains informations on young american men with their **salary** as our dependant variable. The aim of this study is to determine whether or not others variables such as *education*, *experience* or *ethnie* have an impact on the salary of a given american.

In this project we did some **data preprocessing**, **descriptive statistics** and **econometric methods** (correlations, linear regressions, statistical tests).
